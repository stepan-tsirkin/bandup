# BandUP: Band Unfolding code for Plane-wave based calculations             

This is a python interface to the bandUP code. It is under development, 
but you may use it on your own risk.

<!-- =========================================================== -->
## Currently supported plane-wave codes

At the moment, BandUP can parse wavefunctions generated by: 

  * [VASP](http://www.vasp.at)
  * [Quantum ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org)
  * [ABINIT](http://www.abinit.org)
  * any code that has interface to [Wannier90](http://wannier.org)  
  * [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org)  (use the main code of BandUP, not the bandupy)
    (tested with the academic version; currently only 
     available on request)  

<!-- =========================================================== -->
## Publications:

If you use BandUP (or any part or modified version of it) in
your work, you should:

  * **State EXPLICITLY that you've used the BandUP code** 
    (or a modified version of it, if this is the case).
  * **Read and cite the following papers** (and the appropriate
    references therein):
    
>> Paulo V. C. Medeiros, Sven Stafström, and Jonas Björk,
   [Phys. Rev. B **89**, 041407(R) (2014)](
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.041407)  
>> Paulo V. C. Medeiros, Stepan S. Tsirkin, Sven Stafström, and Jonas Björk,
   [Phys. Rev. B **91**, 041116(R) (2015)](
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.041116)


if you use bandupy, that uses functionality implemented 
in the [irrep](https://github.com/stepan-tsirkin/irrep) code, please also cite

>> Mikel Iraola, Juan L. Mañes, Barry Bradlyn, Titus Neupert, Maia G. Vergniory, Stepan S. Tsirkin 
   "IrRep: symmetry eigenvalues and irreducible representations of ab initio band structures", [arXiv:2009.01764](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01764)

An appropriate way of acknowledging the use of BandUP in your
publications would be, for instance, adding a sentence like: 

         "The unfolding has been performed using the BandUP code"

followed by the citation to our papers.
